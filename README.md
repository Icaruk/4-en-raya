## How to play ðŸŽ²
This game is for 2 players: blue (that uses the 'O' token) and red (that uses the 'X' token).<br/>
Click on the buttons 1-6 to drop a token on that column.<br/>
The objective is to align 4 tokens of your color horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/>


## This is my first JS project
